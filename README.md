### **Layout**

* The KiteVenture website has been design with a responsive design , so it adapts the layout deppending on the device/screen size the web is 
displayed.While in a mobile device everything displays in one column due to its size, in bigger devices like tablets, laptops, desktop 
screens the website will display in two, three or four columns depending on the sections needs.

* In order to display a clean and organised layout i have used Bootstrap for the grid system combined with containers, margins, paddings etc...

* The KiteVenture website has been designed under the philoshopy of Mobile-First Design to create a better user experience,
starting the design process  from the smallest of the screens (mobile). In this way we ensure that the users experience is 
seamless on any device.

* Last but not least , i used a maximum width to ensure that in large and very large screens everyhing stays organised, keeping the visual proportions within the screen.

 For KiteVenture website we decide to use fresh colors that remind us the sea for the obvious connection between the sport and the playground. We wanted
 to keep the fresh look of the site without compromising the accesibility for visual impared users, so we make sure that we are working with enought
 contrast along the website for every user. 

 Combining the color palette with the warmth of the images we want to create that feeling of being outside, in the nature, where every adventure takes place
 where KiteVenture is gonna bring you.
