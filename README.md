### **Layout**

* The KiteVenture website has been design with a responsive design , so it adapts the layout deppending on the device/screen size the web is 
displayed.While in a mobile device everything displays in one column due to its size, in bigger devices like tablets, laptops, desktop 
screens the website will display in two, three or four columns depending on the sections needs.

* In order to display a clean and organised layout i have used Bootstrap for the grid system combined with containers, margins, paddings etc...

* The KiteVenture website has been designed under the philoshopy of Mobile-First Design to create a better user experience,
starting the design process  from the smallest of the screens (mobile). In this way we ensure that the users experience is 
seamless on any device.

* Last but not least , i used a maximum width to ensure that in large and very large screens everyhing stays organised, keeping the visual proportions within the screen.

 For KiteVenture website we decide to use fresh colors that remind us the sea for the obvious connection between the sport and the playground. We wanted
 to keep the fresh look of the site without compromising the accesibility for visual impared users, so we make sure that we are working with enought
 contrast along the website for every user. 

 Combining the color palette with the warmth of the images we want to create that feeling of being outside, in the nature, where every adventure takes place
 where KiteVenture is gonna bring you.

 For the dark text we used a Davys Grey , a friendlier and fresher version of the typical black.

 ### **Typography**
 The fonts used in this project are from [Fonts Google](https://fonts.google.com/). The main typography along the whole website is **Roboto**. Its forms are largely geometric, but at the
 same time the font features friendly and open curves. For the headers throughout the website we also used **Roboto**, but in this case we played with its size, weight and letter spacing
 for readability and hierarchy of importance.

 For our logo we used **Rock & Salt**. It is a hand crafted font that gives a fresh, casual and natural look to our logo introducing from the very begining the 
 feeling of adventure to the user. 

 If for any reason the browser used does not support this fonts there are backup fonts asigned to replace the ones we choosed.
 
 Below we can find the imported code from  [Fonts Google](https://fonts.google.com/) to the top of our css file.

 @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300;400;500&family=Rock+Salt&display=swap');

### **Call to action**
We used different techniques for our call in actions, all of them very intuitive for the user to click

* For the logo and the navigation bar when we hover we notice that it change the color telling us that we can do somthing with it. In this case the call 
to action are the words themself. we also used this technic for the email address and location in the footer, linking them to an email and to googlemaps respectively
.

* For the call to action that leads us to the contact form we designed a button, also with a hover effect that echanges the color of the button for the 
color of its text as we hover it. This buttons can be for **Contact us** , **Book now**, or **Submit**.

* For the Social Media call to actions, we didn't create any effects on them since for users in general to click on them is almost a natural reaction.
